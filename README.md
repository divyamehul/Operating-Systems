This project was an assignment as a part of my coursework on Operating Systems at IITH.
There are 4 parts to this, 

1. **Efficient Matrix Squaring**: Perform parallel matrix multiplication in C++.

2. **Thread Affinity**: Evaluate the efficiency of a parallel matrix squaring algorithm by studying the impact
of assigning individual threads to CPU cores.

3. **Dynamic Matrix Squaring**: Perform parallel matrix multiplication through a Dynamic
mechanism in C++.

4. **Readers Writers Problem**: Solve the Readers-Writers problem (writer preference) and Fair Readers-Writers
problem using Semaphores in C++. We implement these two
algorithms and compare each threadâ€™s average and worst-case time to access the critical section
(shared resources).

The folder for each assignment contains a separate Readme, all the source codes, as well as a report on the assignment.
