Assignment 4 - ReadMe File
I have submitted 3 program files, an input file, one for the writer's preference, and one for the fair solution.

First - run the input program - and enter nr, nw, kr, and kw in a space-separated format. This will create the inp.txt file.
Now - run the programs - first the writer's preference and then the fair solution. The log files of both will be created, and the Average_time.txt file will also be created - which will contain the average times of both the reader and writer threads of both the programs. I have also printed the worst case times also in the same Average_time.txt file(for experiments 3 and 4).
