I have designed a total of 8 programs - 4 each for chunk and mixed.
I have designed separate programs for each part of each experiment - to make execution simple.

Execute the input.cpp file, and enter N, K, C, and BT in a space-separated manner. This will be stored in inp.txt file.


I have mentioned below which program to use for which Experiment.


Experiment 1 - 
1. Chunks/Mixed algorithm without being bound to cores - use Assgn2_Chunk1/Assgn2_Mixed1 program here. 

2. Chunks/Mixed algorithm with a given b - use Assgn2_Chunk2/Assgn2_Mixed2 program here. 


While entering the input for Experiment2, ensure that BT = K / 2, as that was the condition mentioned in the assignment

Experiment 2 - 
1. Average Time of Execution without threads being bound to cores - use Assgn2_Chunk3/Assgn2_Mixed3 program here. 

2. Average time of execution of Core-bounded and Normal threads - use Assgn2_Chunk4/Assgn2_Mixed4 program here. Both the average times will be printed into the out.txt file.


Each program will print the resulting square matrix as well as the time taken for that part into the out.txt file.
