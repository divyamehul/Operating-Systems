I have designed a total of 5 programs - 4 for each of the dynamic methods, and 1 program to generate the inp.txt file

First, run the input file - and enter the required n, k, and rowInc values that are desired. This will generate the inp.txt file. After this, run the program file of whichever dynamic method is required - TAS, CAS, CAS(Bounded Waiting), Atomic. They are all in separate program files. 

The output will be printed in an out.txt file. It will print the squared matrix, as well as the time taken into the outfile.
